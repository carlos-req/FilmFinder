## Overview
I enjoyed creating this as it pushed me to learn how to use Fetch() as well as requests work in JavaScript as well as HTTP additionally I also learned about promises and try and catch blocks... This project really made me feel like it was all coming together perfectly and I was really starting to understand everything.
